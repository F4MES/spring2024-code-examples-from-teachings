# Code examples and exercises from "Introduction to python at kea spring 2024"

In this elective your editor will be "Github Codespaces".

## Github Codepsaces
In order for this to work, you will need to have access to [github codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces).    
If you do not allready have that you can get it through [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack#offers) 

### Working with the "Introduction to python" github repository
* Browse to [Introduction to python github repository](https://github.com/python-elective-kea/spring2024-code-examples-from-teachings)
* Click on the green "<> Code" button and then click on "Create codespace on master"

This will open a codespace and this will be your editor in this elective.    

### Important: Working on branches
* You should before doing enything else always create a new branch. (I exspect that you know how to do that).    
* The master branch is "My branch - Claus - The teacher", and this is where all updates to the material during the whole semester will happen.
If you work directly on the master branch, you will have your files overwritten before every session starts (or at least have a lot of merge conflicts you have to solve).    

**So important!! Keep the master branch clean!** 
* Never edit the files directly on the master!
* Always create a new branch when you want to do something to the files. 

### Pull before every session
* Before every session (every class) you should go to the master branch and pull in the changes.
* Then create a new branch (e.g ses2, ses3) and code along or do the exercises.

### Save your work
* You should remember to commit and push the changes you make in your branches.
* This will make a "Fork" on your own account.
